# Depression-Sentiment-Classification-with-BERT-and-Hugging-Face
This project involves developing a sentiment analysis model to classify text data related to depression using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and the Hugging Face library. The goal is to accurately identify the sentiment expressed in social media posts about mental health, specifically focusing on depression-related content. This model can be utilized to support mental health professionals and organizations in understanding public sentiment and identifying individuals who may need help.
