# Depression-Sentiment-Classification-with-BERT-and-Hugging-Face
This project involves developing a sentiment analysis model to classify text data related to depression using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and the Hugging Face library. The goal is to accurately identify the sentiment expressed in social media posts about mental health, specifically focusing on depression-related content. This model can be utilized to support mental health professionals and organizations in understanding public sentiment and identifying individuals who may need help.

# Key Features
1. Data Preprocessing:
	- Loading and preprocessing Twitter data.
	- Handling date-time formats and extracting weekday information for analysis.
	- Visualizing data distribution and sentiment trends.

2. Model Setup:
	- Using the BERT model from Hugging Face's Transformers library.
	- Tokenizing text data for input into BERT.
	- Configuring and fine-tuning the BERT model on the training dataset.
  
3. Training and Evaluation:
	- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
	- Implementing training loops with optimizer and learning rate scheduling.
	- Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

4. Visualization:
	- Plotting training and validation loss for model performance monitoring.
	- Visualizing the confusion matrix to understand model predictions.
	- Displaying example predictions with confidence scores.

5. Prediction on Raw Text:
	- Using the trained model to predict the sentiment of raw text inputs.
	- Demonstrating real-time sentiment prediction for new, unseen text data.
